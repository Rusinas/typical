## Typical

Well, here is my attempt to make a notion-like rich text editor plugin for Vue.js 3. 
It was an interesting journey, but a little bit too much for one person, especially when it comes to the cross-browser/cross-platform compatability, accessibility and stuff like that. 

The main goal behind all this was to create an easily extensible editor to use it in my projects, since almost every one of them is based on some sort of text editing (my blog, my future task management app, my almost ready note taking app).

And this is where my approach is shine - extending editor using plain vue components is such a killer feature (speaking from my experience with other editors). It opens so much opportunities I can't even describe. 

But, despite it being 4th or even 5th iteration (read - written from scratch considering all the previous mistakes), there are still a lot of architectural 'nuances', so I believe it would be hard to understand to someone. Even I don't understand what is going on now (mostly), because the last time I touched it was ~6 months ago.

Well, I don't regret spending 4 years on this. I learned a lot. And I don't regret switching to another editor for my projects, because my time is limited and I want to build useful apps already. But I believe that ideas that I put here has some potential and maybe someone would want to join me to continue? A great opportunity to become an open source contributor I would say ðŸ˜‰
